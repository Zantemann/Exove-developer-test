# Developer test

## 1C. Create a slider in react

I chose this task because it aligns with my interests in full-stack development and primarily focuses on functionality over user interface design. Also I like to work with React.

I implemented a basic slider with an updating value field under it. To fulfill the requirement of triggering an event when the user stops moving the slider,I took a simple approach by using a flag to determine when the slider is released. The flag conditionally renders an additional field displaying the last value.

## 2B. Create an SQL query

I chose this task, because it was different than the first task I made and the databases are relevant in full-stack development. While I've recently worked with NoSQL databases, this task encouraged me to rethink data in differen perspective.

Although the task was straightforward, I decided to test it locally. I created the tables and inserted values. Initially, I wrote the query using SQLite syntax because it was available on my computer. Once it worked, I chose to download MySQL and edit the syntax to work with it.

## 3A. Get data and save it locally

In the third section I chose to work with backend, because also enjoy working in that are, and the 3B required a previous task. For me this was the most interesting task, because there was some challenge.

I chose to write code for this task using Node.js. Because I installed MySQL earlier, I decided to use it for saving the data locally. When running the code, it connects to the database using given environment variables, creates tables, and inserts the data from products.json. Working with MySQL and ensuring data was saved correctly took some time, so additional tasks received less attention.
